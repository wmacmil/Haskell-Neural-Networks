This is an attempt to implement fully functional Stochastic Gradient Descent
algorithm in Haskell.

The files included so far are as follows :

(i) NN.hs : The main file which contains the actual meat. Currently has a lot of boilerplate that needs to be put elsewhere.
(ii) Shuffle.hs : Linear time algorithm from wikihaskell to produce a random permutation of a list
(iii) BooleanFormulas.hs : Implementation of boolean formulas. Uses the state monad to generate tree leaves.
